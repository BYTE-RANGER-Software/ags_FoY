# ags_FoY
9 Verb FoA/FoY template for Adventure Game Studio

This template adds a 9 Verb GUI to AGS, heavily inspired by Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis by LucasArts.
It serves as a template/basis for the development of the fan game Fountain of Youth and can also be used for similar games in the FoY/FoA style.
The graphics included may be freely used and altered in any way.
